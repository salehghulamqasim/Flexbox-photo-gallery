### what did i learn in FCC:
      1- * selector 
      ```
                *{
                   box-sizing:border-box;
                  }
      ```

      2-text transform{uppercase , lowercase}
      3-Flexbox 
      ```
          This will make the element a flex container. 
          Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.
      ```
      4-flex wrap and flex directions
      5-justify content and  align-items
      6-object-fit
      7-gap (gutter)
      8-::after pseudo-element
